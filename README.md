BagPipes
========

BagPipes is a second-generation configuration space exploration framework.  It
enables intelligent, algorithmic exploration of configuration spaces under time
and resource constraints.  A configuration space is defined as a phase of a
pipeline with mutliple components and/or any component with a variable
parameter (discrete- and real-valued, cross products).  The performance of a
generated pipeline is further measured by any number of metrics provided by
scoring annotators.  Furthermore, individual annotators can be scored based on
<some metrics>...

BagPipes can (eventually) parallelize executions for faster evaluation of a
configuration space.
